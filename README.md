# Automated Financial Accounting System: From Transaction Entry to Financial Statements in Excel
## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an automated financial accounting system in Excel that streamlines the recording and processing of transactions. The system will automatically post entries to the General Ledger, extract the Trial Balance, and generate key financial statements, including the Profit & Loss Account and Balance Sheet. This solution aims to enhance efficiency, reduce manual errors, and provide accurate, real-time financial reporting for users.
