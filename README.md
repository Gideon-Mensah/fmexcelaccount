# Automated Financial Accounting System: From Transaction Entry to Financial Statements in Excel
## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an automated financial accounting system in Excel that streamlines the recording and processing of transactions. The system will automatically post entries to the General Ledger, extract the Trial Balance, and generate key financial statements, including the Profit & Loss Account and Balance Sheet. This solution aims to enhance efficiency, reduce manual errors, and provide accurate, real-time financial reporting for users.

- Click on the 'Data' button to navigate to a sheet where you can set up your business name and account structure. The chart of accounts has been pre-configured and should not be modified, as changes could impact the generation of the financial statements. However, you can create new accounts and link them to the pre-determined chart of accounts. You can click on the dashboard button to return to dashboard.

- On the Dashboard, you can navigate between financial statements by clicking the available buttons. To record transactions, simply enter the details in the specified textboxes under the 'Particulars' section, input the account to be debited under the 'Debit' section and the account to be credited under the 'Credit' section, and then click 'Submit.' The system will automatically post the entry to the General Ledger, update the Trial Balance, generate a Profit & Loss statement if needed, and create the Balance Sheet.
